 A Python-Based Bot That Spams WhatsApp Chats

# What it does
Programmatically Spams On Whatsapp via WhatsApp Web

# How to do it
* Clone this repo
* Download the Chrome Driver for your specific Chrome version from here
* Put the driver exe inside the `chromedriver_win32` folder (replace the one there)
* Put the text you want spammed inside `text.txt` (BONUS: Every line is a separate message, so put as much lines as you can to increase the spammability!)
* Inside `SpamBot.py`, change `Pl0x` to the contact/group you want to spam
* Install Python 3 and pip
* Do `pip install selenium`
* Do `python SpamBot.py`
* Chrome should pop up with a whatsapp web page, scan its QR code with your phone
* It'll auto spam the chat you picked
* ENJOY!
